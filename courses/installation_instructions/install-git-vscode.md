## Install VSCode and GIT


* We will use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as our text and code editor.
This widely used software, now owned by Microsoft, is open source and also has multiple plug-ins (add-ons) that add useful features.
All the necessary instructions and software downloads can be found here:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs (Download Visual Studio Code)

  * [Simple Intro Videos](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos) (in English).
   
* We then need GIT (version control software) to synchronize the documents on your computer (locally) with your GitHub repository (online).
  * If not yet available on your laptop, you'll need  to install Git: [Instructions on this website](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).
  * Once GIT is installed, you can activate the connection to GitHub from Visual Studio Code and use this software to version the code and upload it to your project's repository, see [these instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github) and [the description of the whole stage-commit-push workflow](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/quickstart).
