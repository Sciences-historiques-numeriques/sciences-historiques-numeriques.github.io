## Create an account and make your first code repository on GitHub 


Create an account on GitHub by choosing a suitable username: neutral, different from your usual personal logins, short, without capital letters, etc.

Here is the example of my account: https://github.com/atterebf. But of course you can choose a different type of name. Just note that this name will remain, so it's best to think twice about it.


Create a first public code repository in your account, e.g. https://github.com/atterebf/student_repository


IMPORTANT (read carefully):
* choose a simple, meaningful, and clear name for your repository that relates to your topic (just a few words)
* do not use spaces or accents in repository names, only underscores: ‘student_repository’ or dashes: 'student-repository'
* before creating the repository, check: “Add a README file”
* choose a license at random
* create the repository
* then go to the repository https://github.com/atterebf/student_repository, copy all the text of the cc-by-sa-4.0 license, return to the new repository, put the license file in edit mode, and replace all the text of the previously chosen license with the CC 4 license. The license title will automatically change to: cc-by-sa-4.0
* You can create as many public code repositories as you want. And a certain number of private ones
* GitHub repositories are thought to store software, not large files. [**There are limits (see documentation)**](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/repository-limits). If you do not take them into account, you could encounter severe issues. 
* See [additional instructions on this page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account).
